        <ol>
            <li>Download and install <a href="https://www.proxifier.com/">Proxifier</a></li>
            <li>Download and install <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a></li>
            <li>Start Tor Browser and connect to the Tor network. Tor must remain open and connected to the Tor network
                at all times. If closed out, any apps that are using Proxifier will stop working.
            </li>
            <li>Start Proxifier and click "Continue evaluation". Click on "Profile" in the top menu and select "Name Resolution". Deselect Detect DNS settings automatically, select
                Resolve hostnames through proxy, and click OK to exit.
            </li>
            <li>Click Profile again and choose "Proxy Servers". Click Add and enter <span class="highlight">127.0.0.1</span> into the Address field and <span class="highlight">9150</span> into the Port field.
            Select SOCKS version 5 from the Protocol dropdown. Click Check, and you should see a message saying the proxy is ready. Click OK to save. If you get a message
        asking to use this proxy by default, click no.</li>
            <li>
                Click Profile once more and select Proxification Rules. Double click on the Localhost box, and delete everything in
                the Target hosts section. Next click Browse under the Applications section and select all apps you want to be proxied. Change Action
                to Proxy SOCKS5 127.0.0.1 and click OK.
            </li>

            <p>Congratulations, your Tor proxy should now be working through Proxifier!</p>
